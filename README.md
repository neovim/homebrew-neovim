Homebrew formula for neovim.

## Usage

```
$ brew tap neovim/neovim
$ brew install --HEAD neovim
```

To **upgrade** from a previous version:

```text
$ brew update
$ brew reinstall --HEAD neovim
```

For instructions on how to install the Python modules, see [`:help nvim-python`][nvim-python]

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure you're using the right formula. `brew info neovim` should have a
  `From` line similar to this:

  ```text
  From: https://github.com/neovim/homebrew-neovim/blob/master/Formula/neovim.rb
  ```

  If your formula points elsewhere, then you need to retap the neovim formula.
  Do so with the following sequence of commands:

  ```text
  $ brew uninstall neovim --force
  $ brew prune
  $ brew tap neovim/homebrew-neovim
  $ brew tap --repair
  $ brew install neovim --HEAD
  ```
* Run `brew update` — then try again.
* Run `brew doctor` — the doctor diagnoses common issues.
* Check that **Command Line Tools for Xcode (CLT)** and/or **Xcode** are up to
  date by checking for updates in the App Store.
  * If the build fails with `fatal error: '__debug' file not found`,
    you have to install Xcode. This is due to a [bug in the Xcode CLT 6.3][clt-bug].
* You can create a gist log with `brew gist-logs neovim`.
* Use `--verbose` to get the verbose output, i.e. `brew install --HEAD --verbose neovim`.
* Use `--debug` to be in the debug mode. In the debug mode, when failing, you
  can go into the interactive shell to check the building files before homebrew
  neutralizing them.
